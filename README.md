# Java tutorials

* Compile first, with `javac Hello.java`
* Then run the .class file with `java Hello`
* Everything must ultimately go into main in order to run

### Side Notes

* Nearly everything is an object, and everything needs to go into a class
* Typically there will be one main method (another for testing, perhaps)
* Comparisons for truthy/falsy in the place of booleans apparently won't work
  * Checking for true/false requires an actual boolean
* Each statement must end with a semi-colon
* A single line comment starts with two forward slashes
  * `//this is a comment`
* Most whitespace doesn't matter
* Variables are declared with a type and a name (like C#)
  * `int number = 5;`
* Classes and methods must be defined with curly braces
